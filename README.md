# Image Captioning Project Readme
## Overview
This project builds a deep learning-based image captioning system using the Flickr30k dataset. The system takes an image as input and generates a descriptive caption. It combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques.

## Key Steps:
Visualization: Display sample images with their captions.
Preprocessing: Prepare image data and captions for modeling.
Feature Extraction: Use a pre-trained model (InceptionV3) to extract image features.
Modeling: Design and train a sequence-to-sequence model for caption generation.
Inference: Generate captions for new images.

## Model Architecture
The captioning model consists of:
Encoder:
Extracts image features with a dense layer.
Adds dropout for regularization.
Decoder:
Embeds tokenized captions.
Processes embeddings with an LSTM layer.
Combines processed text and image features.

## Output:
A dense layer with softmax activation to predict the next word.

## Caption Generation (Inference)
To generate captions for new images:
Extract image features using InceptionV3.
Use the trained model to predict the next word iteratively until the <end> token is generated or the max caption length is reached.
